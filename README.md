## 🎨 Visual Design Philosophy

**"Mystical Minimalism"**

Using only primitive shapes, we created:
- Sacred geometry patterns
- Glowing ritual circles
- Elemental icons
- Energy flow effects
- Particle magic

**No sprites required!** Everything is:
- `args.outputs.solids` - Filled rectangles
- `args.outputs.borders` - Rectangle outlines
- `args.outputs.lines` - Connecting lines
- `args.outputs.labels` - Text
- Math for circles/animations

This proves you can make beautiful games with just primitives!

## 🔧 Extensibility Examples

### Add a New Ritual (5 minutes)

```ruby
# In ritual_definitions.rb
COSMIC_ALIGNMENT = create_ritual(
  name: "Cosmic Alignment",
  description: "Align the cosmic forces.",
  sequence: [:sun, :moon, :light, :shadow],
  fault_tolerance: :strict,
  difficulty: 6,
  unlock_level: 7
)

# Add to ALL_RITUALS array
ALL_RITUALS = [
  # ... existing rituals
  COSMIC_ALIGNMENT
]
```

Done! The ritual is now playable.

### Add a New Element (15 minutes)

```ruby
# 1. In constants.rb
ELEMENTS = {
  # ... existing elements
  void: {
    name: "Void",
    color: { r: 30, g: 10, b: 50 },
    symbol: "◯",
    unlock_level: 10,
    description: "The element of nothingness"
  }
}

# 2. In primitives_helper.rb
def draw_void_icon(args, x, y, size = 15, color = nil)
  color ||= Constants::COLORS[:void]
  
  # Empty circle (just border)
  args.outputs.borders << {
    x: x - size, y: y - size,
    w: size * 2, h: size * 2,
    r: color[:r], g: color[:g], b: color[:b]
  }
end

# 3. Add case to draw_element_icon
when :void
  draw_void_icon(args, x, y, size, color)
```

Now you can use `:void` in ritual sequences!

### Add Middleware (20 minutes)

```ruby
# Create new middleware
class ScoreMultiplierMiddleware
  def initialize(multiplier)
    @multiplier = multiplier
  end
  
  def call(next_step)
    ->(event, context) do
      result = next_step.call(event, context)
      
      if result.success? && context[:score]
        context[:score] *= @multiplier
      end
      
      result
    end
  end
end

# Use in game_state.rb
chain.use_middleware(&ScoreMultiplierMiddleware.new(1.5).method(:call))
```

All events now get a score multiplier!
